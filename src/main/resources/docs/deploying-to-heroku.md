These instructions will step you through the requirements to deploy an existing Alpas app to Heroku. 

<a name="prerequsities"></a>
### [Prerequisites](#prerequsities)

<div class="sublist">

* A basic Alpas app running locally with a MySQL database connection, checkout the [Quick Start Guide](https://alpas.dev/docs/quick-start-guide-todo-list) to get your first Alpas up and running. 
* A [Heroku account](https://heroku.com/) as well as the [Heroku CLI Tools](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) installed

## [Preparing Your Alpas App](#preparing-your-alpas-app)

<a name="adding-additional-files"></a>
### [Adding Additional Files](#adding-additional-files)

Heroku reads from a special `Procfile` to run your application which should be in the root of your project.  This file should contain the command to execute the project's jar file:

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="1" data-file="Procfile">

```bash
web:  java -jar ./myApp.jar
```
</span>

Additionally, you need a `system.properties` file which will specify for Heroku the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that is required to run the project:

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="1" data-file="system.properties">

```bash
java.runtime.version=1.9
```
</span>

Heroku randomly assigns a port in its environment to serve your app from. This is available from the system environment variable `PORT` but you won't know what it is until runtime, so you can't store it as a concrete environment variable.  Instead, the following allows you to read what the port number is when running and allow your app to be served up there, defaulting to port 8080 in your local environment:

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="1" data-file="src/main/kotlin/configs/PortConfig.kt">

```kotlin

package com.example.myApp.configs

import dev.alpas.AppConfig
import dev.alpas.Environment

@Suppress("unused")
class PortConfig(env: Environment) : AppConfig(env) {
    override val appPort = env("PORT", 8080)
}
```

</span>

<a name="altering-existing-files"></a>
### [Altering Existing Files](#altering-existing-files)

Ensure that you are using Alpas version >=`0.16.3` since this allows you to explicitly set the `APP_HOST` variable
(required later). Check the following and update accordingly in your `build.gradle` file:

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="1" data-file="build.gradle">

```bash
ext.alpas_version = '0.16.3'
```
</span>

Alpas needs a `.env` file in the production environment to run migration scripts amongst other processes. Modify the `start.kt` file to create an empty one in your route directory if it doesn't exist whenever the `main` app function is invoked:

<span class="line-numbers" data-start="1" data-file="src/main/kotlin/start.kt">

```kotlin
package com.example.myApp

import dev.alpas.Alpas
import java.io.File

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val file = File(".env")
    if (!file.exists()) {
        file.createNewFile()
    }
    return Alpas(args).routes { addRoutes() }.ignite()
}
```
</span>

Finally, go ahead and rebuild your project `./alpas jar` <span class="clipboard" data-clipboard-text='./alpas jar'></span>

## [Preparing Your Heroku Environment](#preparing-your-heroku-environment)

<a name="configuring-the-environment"></a>
### [Configuring the Environment](#configuring-the-environment)

You're now ready to set up your Heroku environment:

```bash
heroku create
```

This will create an app in your account and set it as a remote for this project. Logging into your account via the browser
navigate to the `App > Settings` section and click on `Reveal Config Vars`.
 
You will now be able to add in all the contents of your `.env` file. Note, you can also do this via the command line with `heroku config:set {KEY}="{VALUE}"`. Some additional important variables to add:

<div class="sublist">
 
* `APP_HOST = 0.0.0.0` This binds your app to run on `0.0.0.0` rather than localhost (`127.0.0.1`) which is essential for Heroku. Remember, you need to be using Alpas 0.16.3 or greater to get this to work.
* `GRADLE_TASK = shadowJar` This tells Heroku how to build your gradle project.

</div>

Some variables will need to be altered/removed compared to your `.env` file:

<div class="sublist">

* Any of the `DB` configs - these can be added once you have provisioned a database on Heroku.
* `APP_PORT` - this should not be added as you are now dynamically deriving this from our `PortConfig.kt` file.
* `APP_LEVEL = prod` this will put your app into production mode.

</div>

<a name="setting-up-mysql"></a>
### [Setting Up MySQL](#setting-up-mysql)

On Heroku navigate to `Resources` and search for MySQL.  Heroku supports a number of MYSQL database providers. Once installed click on the add-on in Heroku, this will take you to its dashboard page which has some important information:

<div class="sublist">

* The host URL
* The username - note this will most likely not be root and be automatically provisioned
* The password
* The database name - some free tier MySQL plans automatically create one for you and you cannot create additional databases without upgrading to a paid plan
* The port number

</div>

Add these keys to your Heroku `Settings > Config Vars` with the following values:

<div class="sublist">

* `DB_HOST = {The host URL}`
* `DB_CONNECTION = mysql`
* `DB_DATABASE = {The database name}`
* `DB_PORT = {The port}`
* `DB_USERNAME = {The username}`
* `DB_PASSWORD = {The password}`

</div>

## [Deploying and Running Migrations](#deploying-and-running-migrations)

You are now ready to deploy to Heroku!  Make sure you have a compiled jar file in your project root:

```bash
./alpas jar
```

Then deploy your app to Heroku by pushing your repository:

```git
git push heroku master
```

Heroku will then detect that it needs to install the right JDK version (as per our `system.properties` file) and build a gradle project as per the `shadowJar` value we gave it earlier. This should be up and running at your designated Heroku url.

In order to successfully migrate on the free tier of Heroku, you need to temporarily bring down your app as there is not enough RAM on the dyno to both serve the app and run the migration:

```git
heroku ps:scale web=0
```

Then run the migration on Heroku:

```bash
heroku run ./alpas db:migrate
```

Once that has successfully executed you can then bring back up the app

```git
heroku ps:scale web=1
```

Refreshing your browser should bring up your home page and you are up and running in Heroku!

<a name="subsequent-deployments"></a>
## [Subsequent Deployments](#subsequent-deployments)

Having successfully deployed to Heroku, future deployments follow three simple steps:

<div class="ordered-list">

1. Commit your changes and recompile the project `./alpas jar`<span class="clipboard" data-clipboard-text='./alpas jar'></span>.
2. Run `git push heroku master`<span class="clipboard" data-clipboard-text='git push heroku master'></span> to deploy to Heroku.
3. If any migrations are required, follow the [migration steps](#deploying-and-running-migrations) above.

</div>

<a name="troubleshooting"></a>
## [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

You may find that the migration exits too early because the dyno capacity on the free tier has been maxed out.  If this happens try making a trivial change to your project to force a new deploy (with the Heroku web process set to 0), navigate to `App > More > Restart All Dynos` to reset the box.  Then try to run the migration command.

Alternatively try `App > More > Restart All Dynos` followed by `heroku ps:scale web=0`<span class="clipboard" data-clipboard-text='heroku ps:scale web=0'></span> to ensure that the app is not running when trying to run a migration.

### [Migrating with the Compiled Project](#migrating-with-the-compiled-project)

If the problem persists, you will need to run the `db:migrate` command on the compiled jar file.  The normal `alpas` script recompiles the entire project before running the migration which likely requires too much RAM for the lower/free tier dynos.

<div class="ordered-list">

1. Create a new `alpas_prod.sh` file in the root of your project.
2. Copy and paste in the contents of [this sample file](https://gist.github.com/GideonBrimleaf/fb57c60f5b10c547d0f88468d4aaa9ad) into your `alpas_prod.sh` file.  This is very similar to the original `alpas` script but runs against the already compiled jar file rather than using gradle commands which recompile the project. Be sure to rename the jar file reference in the script to your project's jar file after copying over. 
3. As per the original `alpas` script, make sure this new file has executable rights with `chmod +x ./alpas_prod.sh`<span class="clipboard" data-clipboard-text='chmod +x ./alpas_prod.sh'></span>.
4. Step through [Deploying and Running Migrations](#deploying-and-running-migrations) above, substituting `heroku run ./alpas_prod.sh db:migrate`<span class="clipboard" data-clipboard-text='heroku run ./alpas_prod.sh db:migrate'></span> in for the migration command.  This will execute the migration without recompiling the project.
